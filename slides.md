Even if "Visualizing brouhaha" is the title of my presentation, I will not show many visualizations today. I'm rather going to present how I'm struggling to produce visualizations of a quite challenging corpus, that come under what we may call a "brouhaha literature". "Brouhaha literature" is a concept proposed by the french theoritecian Lionel Ruffel in 2016, and ever since more and more used in French literary studies.

I will explain and illustrate in details the concept later, but quickly, let say that brouhaha-literature refers to somes new kinds of heterogeneous corpora, composed of very disseminated sources in and outside the web. Thoses sources can be textual, visual, sound, performance, etc.

Although relevant, and refering to a very large part of contemporary writing and artistic practices, this concept of "brouhaha literature" can be very challenging for computational literary analysis, since the tidy notion of a work to be analyzed is replaced by a never-ending sequence of questions about what belongs and how to apprehend it.

### Visualizing "brouhaha literature":
* can we find some patterns in this cacophony?

===

In fact, "visualizing Brouhaha" may appear like an nonsense: the principle of this literature is to be chaotic.

My question, to carry the metaphor, is: can we see some patterns in this brouhaha? Is it just a cacophony, or can we identify some echos, or even maybe a choral organization?

It was a nice challenge, and I want to thank Stefan Sinclair for his help on this crazy project, that partially failed, but partially only, because as we know, one of the main interest of vizualisation is the hermeneutic process involved in our research and methodology, that can reveal the complexity of our objects.

## "Général [H]instin": a collective project

===

My study case today is the *Général [H]instin* collective, an interdisciplinary and artistic group created in the 1990's, involving more than 200 contributors from many areas: the collective is composed by novelists, poets, performers, visual artists, etc.

===

Adophe Hinstin was a French general who lived during the nineteenth century, died in 1905, and was buried in Paris, at the Cimetière du Montparnasse.

===

In the vault of the Hinstin family, we can find this portrait of Adolphe, printed on a stained-glass window. Due to the printing technique, the portrait is slowly dissolving, giving to the figure of the general this spectral appearance.

In 1997, while he was taking a walk into the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris, the french writer Patrick Chatelier discovered the vault of the Hinstin family.

On his demand, the photographer Juliette Soubrier took some pictures of the vault and of the decomposing portrait.

>(I showed the pictures, I personified the general, and I realized that the artists were absorbing it, transforming it into their own thing. Then it became a collective project.)

The same year, Patrick Chatelier uses the picture for co-creation experiment by a group of artists at the "Squat de la Grange-aux-Belles" -a major place of French counter-culture during the 90's:

>J’ai montré les photos, j’ai un peu personnifié le général et je me suis aperçu que les artistes présents s’en emparaient pour en faire leur propre chose. C’est là que c’est devenu collectif. (Chatelier, 2015, Libération)

>(I showed the pictures, I personified the general, and I realized that the artists were absorbing it, transforming it into their own thing. Then it became a collective project.)

This picture inspires many artists and writers working at the Squat, and leads to the creation of a collective project, quite informal at first.

### From Hinstin to Instin (or GI):
* History to fiction
* Structuration of the group

===

Very quickly, the members of the group don't talk about the Général Adolphe Hinstin, with an H, but about the Général Instin, without the H.

The Général Instin, aka "GI", doesn't belong to History anymore, but to fiction and to art.

§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/revueGeste.png" data-background-size="contain"-->

source image: revue-geste.fr  <!-- .element: class="source" -->

===

So since the beginning, Général Instin is a collective project, which belongs to alternative places, at the margin of institutions (and sometimes, like in the Squat de la Grange aux Belles, at the margin of legality), but also at the margins of Literature, or at least some kind of institutionnal literature, the printed literature, created with "True" publishers.

After a few year, the group publish a few texts in some Journals, like "Geste", but the diffusion of the project remains confidential.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/item-026.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

source image: remue.net

<!-- .element: class="source" -->
===
Around 2007, the project moves to the web, especially on the famous plaform Remue.net, probably one of the most important Journal dedicated to French digital literature.

Remue.net works like a hub and an agregator for a lot of productions of the group, not only the texts, but also the different recordings of performances or public readings about Général Instin.

===

Since more than 12 years, Instin seems to enjoy the web, and doesn't always stay on Remue.

A couple of websites are created for some specific projects.

Instin also has a Facebook and a Twitter profile...

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/interditSaufInstin.jpg" data-background-size="contain"-->

===

Of course, Instin is a literary project, but as you can see, the definition of literature is very inclusive: the project plays with many mediatic and aesthetic forms.

One of the most interesting is probably the poetic game produced with the Street Artist SP38.

SP38 created a logo General Instin, and the members of the group dispose the in different places of the city, in order to create some textual/visual rebus.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/Hinstin-famille.jpg" -->

===

About 10 years ago, the group made an interesting discovery: the Hinstin family belonged to literature since a very long time: some writers as Jarry, Kessel, wrote some fiction about other Hinstin.

At the BNF, there is also a photographic funds of the Hinstin family, because the brother of the Général used to be the teacher (and probably the lover) of the french writer Lautréamont.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/instinPapier.png" -->

===
Finally, since 2016, Général Instin is an author. Already 3 books have been published his name.

===
According to the group, Instin is a gosht corpus, un "corpus fantôme"
[CITER]

This expression evokes one of my main challenges: because of its processual nature, a part of the corpus always seems about to disappear, or to radicaly change. The corpus is still alive and continues to be constructed today as I'm speaking.

## The concept of "Brouhaha literature"


===

In 2016, the French theoretician Lionel Ruffel proposed the concept of "littérature brouhaha" (a brouhaha-literature) to qualify this new condition of literature, characterized by its dissemination in multiple public spaces, and by a strong heterogeneity.

Brouhaha presents 3 main characteristics.

§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/reveGeneral.png" -->

### A literature "out of the book"

===

First of all, it refers to multiple forms of literature emerging out of the printed text -performances, video, photography, social media, websites, etc.

Even if the main characteristic of brouhaha-literature is to stand "out of the book", it's very important to note that brouhaha-literature is not "digital" or "electronic" literature.

"brouhaha" is very inclusive, and also refers to some quite old ways to produce literature: orality and performance are both decisive notions, for example.

The "digital" aspect is very important, of course, but in terms of publication or dissemination, not production, as in electronic literature.

§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/bissp38.png" -->

### Publication as "make public"

===

In other words, "brouhaha literature" refers to an important epistemological shift of contemporary French literature, that is experiencing an with the passage from a conception of literature based on the book (an object and a support for literary contents) to a conception of literature based on an action: publication that, in this way, goes back to its first meaning, "to make public".

The fact that the Général Instin project began at the Squat de la Grange-aux-Belles, an alternative place based on group decision-making, is very significant, and illustrates one of the fondamental aspect of the brouhaha-literature, which places itself into the margins of traditional literary institutions and their hierarchy. As defined by Lionel Ruffel, brouhaha-literature aims to occupy public space, and resist to the printed model.

The web, in this way, could be also considered as a new form of squat, outside of the book.

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/editionInstin.jpg" data-background-size="contain"-->

### Co-authorship

===
Also, brouhaha refers to a principle of co-authorship, in a context where the digital culture seems to (partially) decrease the modern status of the author -as described by Foucault- and reassert the worth of co-creation experiences and collaborative writing (just as early electronic literature and early web literature used to do).

## Building the corpus Instin (and the problems begin)
* An old website
* Several editors
* Problems of structuration

===

Before visualizing the abd confront the notion of brouhaha, I had to collect and prepare my corpus. I chose to focus on 3 websites where we can find Instin stories:
- Remue (this huge platform dedicated to french contemporary literature)
- generalinstin.net (a website dedicated to a specific project)
- hors-sol (a quite recent web Journal)

I was able to extract 152 items - or pages - so it's just a part of the corpus (probably 50%), but it's probably the most important one, in terms of visibility.

The web scraping process hasn't been as easy as expected, because of my level in python (I'm a beginner), but also because of the structure of the data, especially on Remue.net.

Remue is an old platform, playing a major role in the production and diffusion of the French contemporary literature. The website is a spip, a CMS used a lot in the french area.

Working on remue allowed me to make some kind of archeology of the website, and I was able to see how, during the last 12 years, the CMS had been sometimes too rigid for the writers and the editors, who had to do small "hacks" in order to adapt the structure of the CMS to their texts and poetry.

It's also possible to recognize the work of the differents editors or webmasters working who worked on the pages.

In other words, the structuration of the data, on the website, is quite dirty and, with Stefan's help, we had to do many regex...


§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/abnormal.png" data-background-size="contain"-->
<!-- .slide: class="hover" -->

## Methological questions
* granularity
* "nature" of the literary text
* co-authoship

===

The web scraping process also raised some interesting methodological question:
- the question of granularity: some texts are very long, composed of several other texts (what's the best strategy: considering a page, or part of the page?)
- the question of the nature of the literary text: I'll talk about it in a few minutes, but the corpus on Remue contains some "un-creative" texts, as, for example, some announces for an event, for a performance or a festival dedicated to Instin. This is certainly part of the brouhaha, but it adresses the question of the boundaries of literature.
- Co-authorship: in many cases, for a same page or item, there are very different kind of contributors. This problem occurs with the video contents, where we have a film-maker, the writer of the text, the performers...

Instin is a group, a collective: we have to take into account all those different kind of contributors in order to grasp ots dynamic.

### GI, a "brouhaha" or "canon"? <br> (about the "jambon laissé" phenomenon)

===

Regarding the video content, I will just tell you a small anecdote.
While I was working on the transcription of a the video, using the automatic transcription tool of Youtube (which is usually quite performant), I came across an well-known issue that we call, in french "jambon laissé".

"jambon laissé" refers to the translation proposed by some automatic translator systems: "Hamlet", the shakespearian play, is interprated as "Ham - let" or, in french "jambon laissé".

In other words, my transcription was completely absurd and unusable. Why? Because in this video, the reading performance was a canon, the musical concept of the canon: all the readers were reading the same text, together, but with a small gap between them.

I think "canon" is a very promising concept to understand the brouhaha literature: I still need to explore it.

§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/voyantall.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

### (eventually) Vizualising [a little bit]

===

So as you can see, I've been struggling a lot with my corpus, but eventually I managed to create an exploitable corpus, organized by authors and by dates.

I used Voyant to produce some very simple vizualisations, and I'm going to show just a very small but interesting example.

As I told before, the different artists and writers involved into the project use three ways to "call" the Général: "Hinstin" (from the historical figure), its artistic doppleganger "Instin", and also the abbreviation "GI", which offers many interpretations (like, for example, the american figure of the soldier).

If you take a look at the distribution of those names in the corpus through time, we can observe, without surprise, that "Instin" is mainly used in almost all the texts, from the first to the last one.



§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="img/voyantGI.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

===

But it's interesting to note the way Hinstin but is in fact haunting our corpus, regularly making appearances in different text. A closer look at the text reveal Hinstin mostly re-appears into introductive texts to sub-projects.

Hinstin with a "H" is haunting the Instin corpus.

This reiteration underline the presence of an important metadiscourse on the project and corpus itself.

Instin is a ghost, performed by the reiterated story of his disappearance, which finally gives him a supplement of existence.

### Archive 3.0

>The use of archives by artists, critics, and curators in performative contexts has changed the way we understand and work with archives. So, for example, archives, as we have seen, are increasingly utilized as production tools (Osthoff 2009, 11) causing what has been described as a “contamination between artwork and documentation” (p. 11), artworks and archives, archives and found objects, archival practices and everyday life. This changing function of the archive has transformed it from “stable and retroactive” to “generative” (p. 12), which means that the user of the archive also plays a productive part in this process. (Gabriela Giannachi, *Archive Everything: Mapping the Everyday* (2016))

<!-- .element: style="font-size:1.4rem" -->

===

This metafictionnal aspect also explains why I was struggling with my "corpus".

What I was treating as a corpus seems to be primarily an archive.

The construction of the archive goes with the construction of the group metafiction's.

In text mining, the organization of the "corpus" doesn't matters so much. But in this case, the material aspect are important.

In the future, I'll need to explore this tension between the primary corpus and the archive fonction: I need to understand how Instin is build by the "archive", and how this archive aims to become an artistic item.

Archive 3.0 = performative aspect.
